# Visual Score Counter

Tired of checking your acc mid song and missing notes because of it? Wish you could see how certain sections of a map affect your acc in real time? This **custom Counters+ counter** tries to fix all of that by providing you with a visual and colorful representation of the score; easily visible in your peripheral vision as you're playing a song!

## Configuration
  
The following options are available for configuration:
  
**% Ring Shows Next Rank Color**: If enabled, the ring around the accuracy numbers will display the color of the *next* rank - for example, a score of 95.60% will cause the ring to display with the color configured for 96%. All example screenshots/gifs use this setting. Defaulted to ON.

**100% Color**: Self-explanatory. Color to render for an accuracy of 100%.
  
**99% Color**:  Self-explanatory. Color to render for an accuracy of 99%.
  
... and on and on, until 0% :)
