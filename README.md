Tired of checking your acc mid song and missing notes because of it? Wish you could see how certain sections of a map affect your acc in real time? This **custom Counters+ counter** tries to fix all of that by providing you with a visual and colorful representation of the score; easily visible in your peripheral vision as you're playing a song!
