# Visual Score Counter

Tired of checking your acc mid song and missing notes because of it? This **custom Counters+ counter** tries to fix all of that by providing you with a visual and colorful representation of the score; easily visible in your peripheral vision as you're playing a song!

## Warnings

Use at your own risk. This counter hasn't been shown to be accurate in all circumstances - especially at the beginning of replays - and probably won't play nicely with the Counters+ Score counter & base game counter elements. Please contribute if you have a way to help out with currently open issues, as I have no idea what I'm doing and have no time to learn how to fix things the right way :)

## Installation

1) Download the latest release here: <Release link here>
2) Move **VisualScoreCounter.dll** into your **Plugins** folder.
3) Launch the game.
4) Open the **Counters+** mod settings.
5) Ensure that the default **Score** counter is disabled. As of now, the default **Score** counter and the **Visual Score** counter aren't compatible.
